    <h1>Bill Foody</h1>

    <body>
        My father, Bill, lives in St. Augustine, Florida, with my mother, Susan. He works as a gastroenterologist at Flagler Hospital, and in his free time he enjoys running, reading, and spending time at the beach. He began his career as a physician in the US Air Force, where he served for about 20 years and during which time my family moved around the country very frequently. My parents have now settled in St. Augustine, which I now consider my home.
