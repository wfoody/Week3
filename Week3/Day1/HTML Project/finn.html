    <h1>Finn Foody</h1>

    <body>
        Finn is the newest and youngest member of the Foody family. He is a 2-year-old Chocolate Lab who lives with my parents in St. Augustine, Florida. When he's not busy working, he enjoys fine French cuisine, classic cinema, and taking long walks on the beach.
